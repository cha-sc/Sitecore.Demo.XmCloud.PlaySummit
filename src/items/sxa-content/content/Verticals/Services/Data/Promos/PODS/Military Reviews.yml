      Value: " “This has proven to be an awesome service. Affordable, reliable and efficient. They work around you and are willing to go out of their way to meet your needs. Best part is how hands off it is. They can drop off and pick up the container without you there. Customer service is prompt and helpful and both the drivers I met at my old house and new house were very personable and knowledgeable. I 100% recommend them for anyone in need of a quick, affordable move. Also they are very military-friendly.”"

        "Helpful customer service associates, friendly drivers and an especially friendly owner in park city, KS. After a lengthy military move, our final empty PODS was picked up this morning. My husband remarked, “PODS was the most pleasant part of this entire move!”
